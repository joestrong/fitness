# Fitness web app

A simple web app that can track when you do exercises to allow you to space out your workouts over days and when to do the exercise again.

Try out the demo [here](https://fitness.joestrong.co.uk/)

## Features

* **Works offline** like a native app. It does this by using HTML5's application cache. If on mobile try adding the web app to your home screen for a full-screen native feel.
* **Stores data locally** using localstorage.
* **Built in ECMAscript 6** simply for me try next generation javascript today, thanks to Babel and Browserify.
